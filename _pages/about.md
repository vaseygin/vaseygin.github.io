Hello! I completed my PhD at Michigan State University in the Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE) department with [Dr. Andrew Christlieb](https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/andrew-christlieb/) and [Dr. Brian O'Shea](https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/brian-o-shea/). I received my bachelors of science from the University of Michigan, where I double majored in physics and computer science. I'm interested in applying computational techniques to complex physical problems to create and facilitate efficient and accurate models.
