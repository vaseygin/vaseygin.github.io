Hello! I'm a PhD candidate at Michigan State University in the Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE) department. I received my bachelors of science from the University of Michigan, where I double majored in physics and computer science. I'm interested in applying computational techniques to complex physical problems to create and facilitate efficient and accurate models.

I'm currently studying under the guidance of [Dr. Andrew Christlieb](https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/andrew-christlieb/) and [Dr. Brian O'Shea](https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/brian-o-shea/).
